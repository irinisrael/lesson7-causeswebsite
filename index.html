	<h2>Our Mission</h2>
	
	<p>Plants are people. They existed here long before us and even before animals. Yet, we've abused them so much that they have literally de-evolved to avoid competition with us. You see, scientists have found evidence that millions of years ago, plants were the superiors, the Apex Predators so to speak. There are also ancient cavemen drawings of men slaying these giant plants, over-hunting them to near extinction. Men were even tearing up grass and common crops in order to destroy what they considered dangerous monsters. The plants de-evolved entirely into less threatening, less evolved creatures. Now they grow beneath our feet, as we step on them. We need to treat these once great creatures with respect. Unlike animals, plants can't run, can't express their pain and anguish, and most certainly cannot actively protect themselves. That is why we have formed SPAN: Stop Plant Abuse Now! Please help us as we stop plant abuse everywhere.</p>
